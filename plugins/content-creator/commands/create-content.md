# Create Content Command

Generate content using templates and proven patterns.

## Process

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask user for:
- **Content type**: YouTube / Instagram Reel / Instagram Carousel / Newsletter / Blog
- **Topic/theme**: What specific topic?
- **Target audience**: Who is this for?
- **Personal story**: Any relevant personal experience to include?
- **Metrics available**: Specific numbers to cite? (ROI, time saved, etc.)
- **CTA goal**: Newsletter signup / Community / Course / Other?

### 2. Apply Viral Patterns

From the `viral-patterns` skill:
- Apply appropriate hook formula
- Score with Value Equation (target 8+)
- Check STEPPS viral checklist (target 3+/6)
- Use proven hook templates

### 3. Generate Content

For each type, follow structure:

**YouTube:**
```
Hook (0-10s) → Stakes (10-20s) → Credibility (20-30s) →
Promise (30-45s) → Content Sections → Recap → CTA
```

**Instagram Carousel:**
```
Slide 1: Hook
Slides 2-3: Problem
Slides 4-6: Solution
Slide 7: Proof
Slide 8: CTA
```

**Instagram Reel:**
```
Hook (0-3s) → Context (3-10s) → One Key Point (10-50s) → CTA (last 5s)
```

**Newsletter:**
```
Personal Hook → Main Story → Quick Insights →
Community Highlights → Challenge/CTA
```

**Blog:**
```
Personal Hook → Problem → Why Current Approaches Fail →
Better Way → Implementation → Results → CTA
```

### 4. Apply Natural Writing Filter

From the `natural-writing` skill:
- Eliminate AI-flagged words
- Add contractions
- Vary sentence length
- Include personality and opinions
- Make it sound human

### 5. Create Multiplication Plan

Suggest derivatives:
- How this content can be repurposed
- Which platforms to distribute to
- Timing recommendations

### 6. Quality Checklist

Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Hook in first 3 seconds/sentences
- [ ] Personal story or specific metric included
- [ ] STEPPS score 3+/6
- [ ] Value Equation score 8+
- [ ] Clear, single CTA
- [ ] Natural writing filter applied
- [ ] Sounds like a real person wrote it
