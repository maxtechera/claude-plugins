# Find Topic

Find winning content topics that attract leads and position you as an authority.

## The Core Rule

**"How I" beats "How To" every time.**

| Generic | Credible |
|---------|----------|
| How to get more leads | How I got 1,000 leads in 30 days |
| How to automate | How I automated 80% of my workflow |

## Process

### Step 1: Ask the User

1. **What's your core offer?** (What you sell)
2. **Who's your audience?** (Be specific)
3. **What problem have you solved recently?** (With results)

### Step 2: Apply Filters

**Green Flags:**
- Specific outcome ("How I reduced X by Y%")
- Narrow audience ("For React developers")
- Personal proof (your actual results)
- Solves real pain

**Red Flags:**
- Too broad ("How to be successful")
- No personal experience
- No metrics or proof

### Step 3: Score Credibility (out of 12)

| Question | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Have you done this successfully? | +3 |
| Do you have specific metrics? | +3 |
| Is this your expertise? | +2 |
| Have you helped others? | +2 |
| Can you show proof? | +2 |

- **8-12**: Go ahead
- **5-7**: Gather more proof first
- **0-4**: Pivot or gain experience

## Output
