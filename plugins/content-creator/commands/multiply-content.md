# Multiply Content Command

Transform one piece of content into 15+ assets across all platforms.

## Process

### 1. Identify Source Content

Ask user for:
- **Source**: What's the original content? (YouTube video, blog post, tweet, etc.)
- **Core message**: What's the main takeaway?
- **Key moments**: Any specific quotes, stats, or stories that stand out?
- **Target platforms**: Where do you want to distribute?

### 2. Extract Clipable Moments

Identify 3-5 moments that can stand alone:
- Strong hooks
- Quotable insights
- Surprising stats
- Personal stories
- Clear takeaways

### 3. Generate Platform-Specific Assets

For each platform, create adapted content:

**YouTube Shorts (3-5 clips)**
```
- Vertical format
- Hook in first second
- Text on screen
- 15-60 seconds
- No intro/outro needed
```

**Instagram Reels (3-5 clips)**
```
- Vertical format
- Trending audio if applicable
- Personal/casual tone
- 15-90 seconds
- Strong visual hook
```

**Instagram Carousel (1-2)**
```
- 5-10 slides
- One idea per slide
- Hook on slide 1
- CTA on final slide
- Design notes included
```

**Twitter Thread (1)**
```
- 5-15 tweets
- Hook in tweet 1
- One idea per tweet
- End with CTA
```

**LinkedIn Post (1)**
```
- Professional tone
- Business outcomes
- 500-1500 words
- CTA in comments
```

**Blog Post (1)**
```
- Full expansion of topic
- SEO-optimized
- Internal linking opportunities
- Lead magnet connection
```

### 4. Create Distribution Schedule

```
Day 1 (Monday): Main content publishes
Day 2 (Tuesday): Newsletter feature
Day 3-4: Short-form clips (Instagram, TikTok)
Day 5 (Friday): LinkedIn professional post
Weekend: Stories, casual engagement
```

### 5. Quality Check Each Asset

For each piece:
- [ ] Can stand alone (no context needed)
- [ ] Has strong hook
- [ ] Platform-native format
- [ ] Clear CTA
- [ ] Natural writing applied
