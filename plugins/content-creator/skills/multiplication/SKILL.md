```
ONE IDEA → MULTIPLE FORMATS → ALL CHANNELS → REVENUE

## Production Workflow

### Step 1: Create Core Content
- Record main video OR write main post
- Include: hook, stakes, credibility, solution, CTA
- Capture raw footage/material for clips

### Step 2: Extract Key Moments
- Identify 3-5 quotable/clipable moments
- Mark timestamps for shorts
- Note standalone insights

### Step 3: Create Platform Derivatives

For each platform:
1. **Adapt format** (vertical/horizontal/square)
2. **Adjust length** (15s/30s/60s/long)
3. **Customize CTA** for platform
4. **Apply platform voice** (LinkedIn = professional, Instagram = casual)

### Step 4: Schedule Distribution

| Day | Platform | Content |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Monday | YouTube | Long-form publish |
| Tuesday | Newsletter | Feature edition |
| Tue-Thu | Instagram | Reels + Stories |
| Wed-Fri | Twitter | Thread + clips |
| Thursday | LinkedIn | Professional post |

---

## Content Verticals Split

| Vertical | % | Topics |
|----------|---|--------|
| Technical Authority | 40% | Tutorials, how-tos, tools |
| Journey & Transparency | 30% | Personal story, real numbers, fails |
| Philosophy & Mindset | 20% | Principles, frameworks, beliefs |
| Community & Success | 10% | Client wins, case studies, spotlights |

---

## Repurposing Rules

1. **Never just repost** - Adapt for each platform
2. **Lead with value** - Not "check my YouTube"
3. **Native format** - Vertical for IG/TikTok, horizontal for YouTube
4. **Platform voice** - LinkedIn more professional, Instagram more casual
5. **Stagger timing** - Don't flood all channels same day

---

## Clip Extraction Criteria

**A clip works when it has:**
- [ ] Self-contained story or insight
- [ ] Strong hook in first 3 seconds
- [ ] Clear takeaway without needing context
- [ ] Length appropriate for platform (15-60s)
- [ ] Ends with implicit or explicit CTA

---

## Platform-Specific Adaptations

### YouTube Shorts (15-60s)
- Vertical format
- Hook immediately
- Text on screen (50% watch muted)
- No intro/outro

### Instagram Reels (15-90s)
- Vertical format
- Trending audio optional
- Strong hook
- Personal/casual tone

### Instagram Carousel (5-10 slides)
- Square or 4:5 format
- Hook on slide 1
- One idea per slide
- CTA on final slide

### Twitter/X Thread (5-15 tweets)
- Hook in tweet 1
- One idea per tweet
- Add images where possible
- End with CTA + retweet request

### LinkedIn Post (500-1500 words)
- Professional tone
- Business outcomes focus
- Line breaks for readability
- CTA to engage in comments

## Automation Checklist

To systematize multiplication:

- [ ] Record with clips in mind (mark moments)
- [ ] Batch edit all clips in one session
- [ ] Use templates for each platform format
- [ ] Schedule all posts in advance
- [ ] Repurpose high performers again at 30 days

---

## ROI Calculation

```
1 YouTube video (4 hours to create)
→ 20 pieces of content
→ 4 platforms
→ ~80 touchpoints with audience

Cost per touchpoint: 3 minutes
vs. creating 20 pieces separately: 40+ hours
```

**Multiplication = 10x content ROI**
