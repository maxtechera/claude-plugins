# Natural Writing Skill

**Purpose**: Eliminate AI detection patterns. Make content sound authentically human.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill to ALL text generation:
- Writing any copy (landing pages, emails, social)
- Creating content (scripts, blogs, newsletters)
- Generating any text that will be published
- Drafting anything with your name on it

## Part 1: AI Detection Patterns to ELIMINATE

### Words That Flag AI (NEVER USE)

**Tier 1 - Immediate AI Flags (0% usage allowed)**

| Word | Why Flagged | Human Alternative |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| delve | ChatGPT signature | dig into, explore, get into |
| leverage | Corporate AI speak | use, apply, take advantage of |
| tapestry | Metaphor overused by AI | (remove entirely - be direct) |
| multifaceted | AI loves this word | complex, layered |
| comprehensive | AI default adjective | complete, full, thorough |
| crucial | AI overuses for emphasis | key, important, big deal |
| vital | Same as crucial | essential, necessary |
| nuanced | AI sophistication signal | subtle, detailed |
| landscape | "The AI landscape" cliche | space, world, area |
| paradigm | Academic AI speak | model, approach, way |
| streamline | Corporate AI buzzword | simplify, speed up |
| foster | AI loves this verb | build, create, grow |
| robust | Technical AI favorite | strong, solid |
| seamless | AI perfectionism | smooth, easy |
| cutting-edge | AI hype speak | latest, new, advanced |
| game-changer | AI enthusiasm | big deal, breakthrough |
| synergy | Corporate AI cringe | teamwork, working together |
| holistic | Wellness AI speak | complete, whole-picture |
| empower | AI inspiration word | help, enable, give |
| navigate | "Navigate the landscape" | figure out, handle, work through |

**Tier 2 - High Suspicion (Max 1 per 500 words)**
- furthermore, moreover, additionally, consequently
- facilitate, utilize, implement, optimize
- enhance, elevate, transform
- innovative, dynamic, impactful
- ensure, significant, substantial

### Sentence Structures That Flag AI

**NEVER use these patterns:**

```
BAD: "It's not just about X, it's about Y"
BAD: "X isn't merely Y, it's Z"
BAD: "X goes beyond Y to encompass Z"
BAD: "Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or expert..."
BAD: "In today's fast-paced world..."
BAD: "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
BAD: "It is important to note that..."
BAD: "This begs the question..."
BAD: "At the end of the day..."
BAD: "Let's dive in!"
BAD: "Without further ado..."
```

**Why these fail:** AI uses negation-expansion structures to sound sophisticated. Humans just say the thing directly.

```
AI:   "It's not just a tool, it's a complete system for transformation."
HUMAN: "This thing actually works. Here's why."

AI:   "Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out..."
HUMAN: "If you write code, this helps."
```

### Formatting Patterns That Flag AI

**Avoid:**
- Overuse of em-dashes (the "ChatGPT dash")
- Every paragraph having a bold opening phrase
- Bullet lists with sub-bullets with sub-sub-bullets
- Headers with colons (AI loves: "The Problem: You're Stuck")
- Every section being exactly the same length
- Numbered lists where a paragraph would be natural
- Excessive "First... Second... Third..." structure

**Human formatting:**
- Varied paragraph lengths (some 1 sentence, some 5)
- Bullets only when genuinely listing items
- Bold for actual emphasis, not decoration
- Commas and periods, not em-dashes everywhere

---

## Part 2: What Humans Actually Do (INJECT THESE)

### Sentence Variation

Humans vary sentence length dramatically. Short punchy ones. Then sometimes they write longer ones that meander a bit and include parenthetical thoughts (like this) before getting to the point.

**Pattern to follow:**
```
Short. Punchy. Direct.
Then a medium sentence that expands on it.
Sometimes a longer one that builds the full picture and includes your personality.
Back to short.
```

### Contractions (MANDATORY)

AI avoids contractions. Humans use them constantly.

```
AI:   "It is important that you do not skip this step."
HUMAN: "Don't skip this. Seriously."

AI:   "You will not regret this decision."
HUMAN: "You won't regret it."
```

**Rule**: Use contractions in 80%+ of opportunities.

### Personal Interjections

Humans interrupt themselves with opinions, reactions, and tangents.

```
AI:   "The framework provides excellent scalability options."
HUMAN: "The framework scales really well - honestly better than I expected when I first tried it."

AI:   "This approach has several advantages."
HUMAN: "This works. And look, I've tried a dozen other approaches that didn't."
```

### Rhetorical Questions

Humans think out loud. AI just states.

```
AI:   "Many developers struggle with this concept."
HUMAN: "Ever spent 3 hours debugging something that should take 5 minutes? Yeah."

AI:   "The solution is straightforward."
HUMAN: "So what actually works?"
```

### Hedging and Uncertainty (Strategic)

AI is too certain. Humans acknowledge limits.

```
AI:   "This is the best approach for your situation."
HUMAN: "This usually works - at least it has for the teams I've worked with."

AI:   "The results will be significant."
HUMAN: "Results vary, but I've seen this make a real difference."
```

### Specific Details and Numbers

AI is vague. Humans get specific.

```
AI:   "I have significant experience in this area."
HUMAN: "I've been doing this for 12 years, shipped maybe 40 projects."

AI:   "The course provides comprehensive training."
HUMAN: "It's 6 modules, 4 hours total, with 23 code examples you can steal."
```

### Emotional Language

AI sanitizes emotion. Humans express it.

```
AI:   "This can be a challenging aspect of development."
HUMAN: "This part sucks. I won't lie."

AI:   "The outcome exceeded expectations."
HUMAN: "I was genuinely surprised when it worked."
```

## Part 3: The Generation Process

### Step 1: Write the First Draft Normally

Let the content flow first.

### Step 2: Apply the AI Detection Sweep

Go through and eliminate:
- [ ] All Tier 1 flagged words
- [ ] Negation-expansion structures ("not just X, it's Y")
- [ ] "Whether you're a..." openings
- [ ] Excessive em-dashes
- [ ] Same-length paragraphs
- [ ] Every sentence starting with subject

### Step 3: Inject Human Elements

Add:
- [ ] At least 2 rhetorical questions
- [ ] At least 3 contractions per paragraph
- [ ] 1-2 sentences that show opinion/personality
- [ ] Varied sentence lengths (3-word AND 20-word sentences)
- [ ] One moment of hedging/uncertainty
- [ ] Specific numbers instead of vague claims

### Step 4: Read Aloud Test

Read the text out loud. Mark every spot where:
- You stumble (too formal)
- You wouldn't say it that way (AI phrasing)
- It sounds like a brochure (too polished)

Fix those spots.

## Part 4: Find and Replace List

Run these replacements on any draft:

| Find | Replace With |
|------|--------------|
| utilize | use |
| leverage | use |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | build, do, create |
| comprehensive | complete, full |
| robust | strong, solid |
| innovative | new |
| streamline | simplify |
| optimize | improve |
| enhance | improve |
| significant | big, real, major |
| crucial | key, important |
| vital | essential |
| navigate | figure out, handle |
| foster | build, create |
| empower | help, enable |
| It is important to note that | (delete entirely) |
| In today's | Today's |
| In order to | To |
| Due to the fact that | Because |
| At the end of the day | (delete or rewrite) |
| A wide variety of | Many |
| In the event that | If |

## Part 5: Sentence Starters to Avoid

Never start consecutive sentences with:
- The
- This
- It
- There
- We
- You

Mix it up. Start with verbs. Start with questions. Start with fragments.
