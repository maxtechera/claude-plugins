# Viral Hooks

Proven formulas for hooks that stop the scroll.

## The "How I" Rule

**"How I" beats "How To" every time.**

| Generic | Credible |
|---------|----------|
| How to get more leads | How I got 1,000 leads in 30 days |
| How to automate | How I automated 80% of my workflow |
| Tips for productivity | My system that saves me 10 hours/week |

**Formula**: "How I" + [specific result] + [timeframe]

## 6 Hook Templates

| Type | Formula |
|------|---------|
| **Money** | "I spent $[X] on [thing]..." |
| **Counterintuitive** | "Why [positive people] stay [negative]" |
| **Journey** | "How I went from [A] to [B] in [time]" |
| **Failure** | "The $[X] mistake that almost..." |
| **Secret** | "What [experts] don't tell you..." |
| **Result** | "How I [result] without [method]" |

## First 10 Seconds

| Second | Element | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 0-3 | Hook | "I spent $800 this week..." |
| 3-6 | Stakes | "...and it changed everything" |
| 6-8 | Credibility | "After 10 years in tech..." |
| 8-10 | Promise | "Here's exactly how" |
