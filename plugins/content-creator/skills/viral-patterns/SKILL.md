# Viral Patterns Skill

Proven patterns for content that gets engagement, shares, and conversions.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating hooks for videos or posts
- Designing thumbnails
- Writing headlines
- Optimizing content for engagement
- Planning viral campaigns

---

## The "Hook, Retain, Reward" Model

Master framework for viral content:

```
HOOK (First 3 seconds)
├── Pattern interrupt: Bold statement, surprising stat, pain-point
├── 50% watch without audio - text on screen essential
├── Goal: Stop the scroll
└── Use "How I" for credibility

RETAIN (Middle 3-45 seconds)
├── Story structure: Tease → Build → Reveal
├── Don't dive straight into lesson
├── Neural coupling: Brain syncs with storyteller
└── Keep teasing the main point

REWARD (End)
├── Deliver massive value
├── Clear, actionable takeaway
└── Strong CTA
```

---

## The Value Equation for Hooks

```
Score = (Dream Outcome x Likelihood) / (Time x Effort)
Target: Score 8+
```

**Scoring Guide:**
- Dream Outcome (1-10): How big is the transformation?
- Likelihood (1-10): How believable is success?
- Time (1-10, inverted): How fast? (10=instant)
- Effort (1-10, inverted): How easy? (10=effortless)

### Hook Optimization Example

```
Before: "How to grow on Instagram"
Score: (5 x 3) / (8 x 8) = 0.23

After: "How I grew from 0 to 10K followers in 30 days without posting daily"
Score: (9 x 7) / (3 x 2) = 10.5

What changed:
- "How I" → adds proof (likelihood)
- "0 to 10K" → specific dream outcome
- "30 days" → reduces time
- "without posting daily" → reduces effort
```
