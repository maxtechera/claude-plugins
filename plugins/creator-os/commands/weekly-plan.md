# Weekly Plan Command

Execute Monday planning ritual.

## Process

### 1. Load State Files

Read your:
- Ship calendar (upcoming ships)
- Project state (metrics, milestones)
- Last week's sprint
- Archive (recent completions)

### 2. Ship Calendar Validation

**Before proceeding, verify:**

```
### Ship Calendar Check

| Item | Ship Date | Days | Progress |
|------|-----------|------|----------|
| [Item 1] | [Date] | [X]d | [X]% |
| [Item 2] | [Date] | [X]d | [X]% |

Calendar Status: [HEALTHY / GAP / OVERDUE]
```

**If GAP (no ship in next 7 days):**
- STOP planning
- Add a ship date first
- "What will you SHIP this week?"

**If OVERDUE:**
- Address overdue item first
- Either complete it or reschedule

### 3. Review Last Week

- What shipped?
- What didn't ship and why?
- Any lessons to apply?

### 4. Define Big 3

According to the rhythm:
- **1 Norte dominante** - one thing that makes everything else easier
- **2 Satelites max** - things that can't die but don't lead

### 5. Create Week Plan

```
## Week [N] Plan - [Date Range]

**Theme**: [Week focus]
**Quarter Goal**: [Reminder of main objective]

### Ship Calendar This Week

| Ship Date | Item | Progress | Status |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|
| [Day] | [Item] | [X]% | MUST SHIP |

### Big 3 This Week
1. 🎯 **SHIP**: [Primary deliverable] - [Ship Date]
2. 📦 [Secondary deliverable]
3. 📦 [Tertiary deliverable]

### Daily Breakdown
| Day | Focus | Key Action |
|-----|-------|------------|
| Monday | Planning | This plan |
| Tuesday | [Execution] | [Action] |
| Wednesday | [Execution] | [Action] |
| Thursday | [Execution] | [Action] |
| Friday | Review + Ship | [Ship item] |

### KPIs to Hit
- [Metric 1]: [Target]
- [Metric 2]: [Target]

### Kill List (NOT doing this week)
- [Explicitly deferred item 1]
- [Explicitly deferred item 2]

### Success Definition
"[One sentence: what does 'winning' look like Friday?]"
```

### 6. Commit to Plan

Once plan is created:
- Update sprint file
- Block calendar for execution time
- Share with accountability partner if applicable
