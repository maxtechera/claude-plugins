# Sabotage Detection Skill

Patterns that look like productivity but prevent shipping.

## When to Use This Skill

- Feeling busy but not shipping
- Multiple projects open, none complete
- Constant context switching
- Tools/systems changing frequently
- Weeks passing without deliverables

---

## The 7 Sabotage Patterns

### 1. Dispersion Noble (Noble Dispersion)

**Pattern**: Too many things "in progress", nothing completing.

**Detection**:
- Tasks in progress > 5
- Tasks completed this week = 0

**Symptoms**:
- "I'm working on so many things"
- Context switching constantly
- Starting new before finishing old

**Fix**:
- Freeze all new work
- Complete ONE thing before starting another
- Reduce to 3 max concurrent items

---

### 2. Dopamina de Inicio (Startup Dopamine)

**Pattern**: Getting high on starting, not finishing.

**Detection**:
- Open projects/initiatives > 3
- Recent starts without recent finishes

**Symptoms**:
- Excitement when starting
- Boredom when in the middle
- "This new thing is better"

**Fix**:
- 48-hour rule: no new project until current ships
- Document the "boring middle" as part of the plan
- Celebrate finishes, not starts

---

### 3. Perfeccionismo con Disfraz (Disguised Perfectionism)

**Pattern**: Polishing instead of shipping.

**Detection**:
- Days since last content published > 5
- "Almost ready" status for weeks

**Symptoms**:
- "It needs one more thing"
- Endless revisions
- Fear of judgment

**Fix**:
- Set hard ship dates
- "Ship Broken" rule: imperfect > invisible
- V1 is meant to be ugly

---

### 4. Optimizacion Prematura (Premature Optimization)

**Pattern**: Building tools instead of using them.

**Detection**:
- Tool/system changes > publications this week

**Symptoms**:
- Redesigning workflows
- New tools every week
- "This will save time later"

**Fix**:
- Freeze tool changes for 30 days
- Use current tools, even if imperfect
- Only optimize after shipping 10x

---

### 5. Negociar con Vos Mismo (Self-Negotiation)

**Pattern**: Changing priorities mid-week without reason.

**Detection**:
- Priorities changed without documented rationale

**Symptoms**:
- "This is more important now"
- Monday plan abandoned by Wednesday
- Reactive instead of proactive

**Fix**:
- Monday plan is locked until Friday
- Document any priority change with reason
- Only change for external emergency

---

### 6. Ansiedad de Oportunidad (Opportunity Anxiety)

**Pattern**: Can't say no, fear of missing out.

**Detection**:
- Kill list is empty
- Deferred vault is empty
- Everything feels urgent

**Symptoms**:
- "I should probably do this"
- Can't defer anything
- Every opportunity feels important

**Fix**:
- Maintain active kill list
- "Not this quarter" vault
- Explicit "NO" is required for every "YES"

---

### 7. Rumiacion Productiva (Productive Rumination)

**Pattern**: Planning/documenting without delivering.

**Detection**:
- Lots of plans, no deliverables
- Documentation heavy, output light

**Symptoms**:
- "I need to think about this more"
- Perfect plans, no execution
- Research without action

**Fix**:
- Time-box planning to 1 hour max
- Every plan needs a ship date
- Deliverable must be defined before planning

---

## Threshold Table

| Pattern | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Dispersion Noble | >5 open, 0 complete | Freeze new work |
| Dopamina de Inicio | >3 projects | 48h no new starts |
| Perfeccionismo | >5 days no ship | Ship something today |
| Optimizacion Prematura | changes > publishes | 30-day tool freeze |
| Negociar con Vos Mismo | plan changed | Document reason or revert |
| Ansiedad de Oportunidad | empty kill list | Add 3 items to kill list |
| Rumiacion Productiva | detected | Set ship date immediately |

---

## Emergency Protocol

When 3+ patterns are active:

### 48-Hour Reset

1. **Dormir** - 7-7.5 hours tonight, no negotiation
2. **Entrenar** - Physical activity tomorrow
3. **1 Entrega Chica** - Pick smallest completable task
4. **Cortar Inputs** - No social media, no news for 48h
5. **Plan en 10 Lineas** - Rewrite entire plan in max 10 lines

### The Truth

> "Tu limite no es talento ni disciplina; es incapacidad de elegir una cosa y renunciar a diez sin perder identidad."

Your limit isn't talent or discipline. It's the inability to choose one thing and give up ten without losing your identity.
