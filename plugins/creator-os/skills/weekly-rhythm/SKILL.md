## Monday: Planning Day

### Morning Ritual

1. **Check Ship Calendar** (5 min)
   - What ships this week?
   - Any overdue items?
   - Calendar gaps?

2. **Define Big 3** (15 min)
   - 1 Norte dominante (main focus)
   - 2 Satelites max (supporting work)

3. **Block Calendar** (10 min)
   - Protect execution time
   - Schedule ship dates

### Big 3 Format

```
1. 🎯 SHIP: [Primary deliverable] - [Ship Date]
2. 📦 [Secondary deliverable]
3. 📦 [Tertiary deliverable]
```

### Kill List (Critical)

Explicitly list what you're NOT doing this week:
- "Not starting new projects"
- "Not refactoring X"
- "Not answering cold emails"

---

## Tuesday-Thursday: Execution Days

### Daily Pattern

```
Morning (First 4 hours):
└── Primary creative/shipping work
└── No meetings, no email
└── Focus on Big 3 item 1

Afternoon:
└── Meetings if necessary
└── Administrative tasks
└── Content publishing
```

### Execution Rules

1. **No new planning** - Monday's plan is locked
2. **Ship > polish** - Done is better than perfect
3. **Daily check-in** - 5 min review of progress
4. **Block distractions** - No social, no news

### Daily Check-In Questions

- What evidence would an outsider see that I made progress?
- Am I working on Big 3 item 1?
- Any blockers to escalate?

---

## Friday: Review Day

### Review Ritual

1. **Metrics Review** (15 min)
   - What moved this week?
   - What didn't move?
   - Any surprises?

2. **Wins Inventory** (10 min)
   - What shipped?
   - What worked?
   - What to repeat?

3. **Lessons Learned** (10 min)
   - What failed?
   - Why?
   - What to change?

4. **ONE Adjustment** (5 min)
   - Pick ONE thing to change next week
   - Not multiple changes - just one

### Review Output Format

```
## Week [N] Review

### Shipped
- [Deliverable 1] ✓
- [Deliverable 2] ✓

### Metrics Movement
- [KPI]: [Start] → [End] ([+/-]%)

### Top Win
[What worked best and why]

### Top Lesson
[What didn't work and why]

### ONE Adjustment for Next Week
[Single specific change]
```

## Calendar Rules

### Protected Time

| Block | Purpose | Negotiable? |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Morning (4h) | Creative work | NO |
| Ship dates | Deliverable deadlines | NO |
| Friday PM | Weekly review | NO |

### Meeting Rules

1. **No meetings before noon**
2. **Batch meetings on Tuesday/Thursday**
3. **Default to 25 min, not 30**
4. **Async > sync when possible**

---

## Recovery Protocol

When the week goes off track:

### If Tuesday and Still No Progress

1. Cancel non-essential meetings
2. Shrink Big 3 to Big 1
3. Ship something small today

### If Friday and Nothing Shipped

1. Ship SOMETHING before EOD
2. Document what blocked you
3. Add it to lessons learned
4. Plan smaller for next week

### Emergency Reset (3+ Patterns Active)

1. **Dormir** - 7-7.5 hours, no negotiation
2. **Entrenar** - Physical activity
3. **1 Entrega Chica** - Smallest completable task
4. **Cortar Inputs** - No social media, no news
5. **Plan en 10 Lineas** - Rewrite plan simply
