# Find Topic Command

Select winning content topics using Alex Hormozi's framework from $100M Leads.

## The Topic Selection Framework

### Core Principle: Narrow > Broad

**"Be the king of a puddle before trying to be a fish in the ocean."**

Topics should be:
1. **Narrow** - Precise rather than broad
2. **Meaningful** - Solve "painkillers" not "nice-to-haves"
3. **Monetizable** - Target audiences who can pay
4. **Credible** - Within your demonstrated expertise

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define Your Puddle

Ask:
- **What's your core offer?** (The thing you sell or want to sell)
- **Who's your target audience?** (Be specific)
- **What problem do you solve?** (The narrow, specific pain point)

### Step 2: Apply the "How I" vs "How To" Filter

**Shift from "How to" to "How I"**

| Generic "How To" | Credible "How I" |
|------------------|------------------|
| How to get more leads | How I got 1,000 leads in 30 days |
| How to automate your business | How I automated 80% of my workflow |
| How to grow on Instagram | How I grew from 0 to 10K followers |

**Why this works:**
- "How I" requires receipts (proof)
- Establishes authority through results
- Harder to copy (your story is unique)
- More engaging and personal

### Step 3: The Problem-Solution Cycle

Map adjacent opportunities:

```
Core Problem → Solution → Next Problem → Next Solution
     ↓
   Content Topic 1
        ↓
      Content Topic 2
           ↓
         Content Topic 3
```

### Step 4: The Lead Magnet Test

A good topic should pass the lead magnet criteria:

**The 3 Lead Magnet Types:**
1. **Reveal a problem** they don't know about (diagnosis)
2. **Solve temporarily** (sample/trial)
3. **Give one step** in a multi-step process (partial solution)

Ask: "Could this topic become a lead magnet?" If yes, it's a winner.

### Step 5: Credibility Score

| Question | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Have you done this successfully? | +3 |
| Do you have specific metrics/results? | +3 |
| Is this within your niche expertise? | +2 |
| Have you helped others achieve this? | +2 |
| Can you show "receipts" (proof)? | +2 |

**Scoring:**
- 8-12: Excellent topic - proceed
- 5-7: Good topic - gather more proof first
- 0-4: Weak topic - pivot or gain experience first
