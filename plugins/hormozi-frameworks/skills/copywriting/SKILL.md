## Headline Formulas

### The Pattern

```
"ARE YOU THE [NEGATIVE IDENTITY] TO YOUR OWN [IMPORTANT THING]?"
```

### Formula Variations

| Pattern | Structure | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Identity Attack | "ARE YOU THE [NEGATIVE] TO YOUR OWN [THING]?" | "ARE YOU THE BIGGEST RISK TO YOUR OWN BUSINESS?" |
| Hidden Saboteur | "IS [WEAKNESS] KILLING YOUR [OUTCOME]?" | "IS YOUR MANUAL PROCESS KILLING YOUR MARGINS?" |
| Counterintuitive | "WHY [POSITIVE PEOPLE] STAY [NEGATIVE STATE]" | "WHY SMART FOUNDERS STAY BROKE" |
| Uncomfortable Truth | "THE [ADJECTIVE] TRUTH ABOUT [GOAL]" | "THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH ABOUT SCALING" |

### Headline Rules

- ALL CAPS always (visual dominance)
- Must be answerable with "maybe..." by the reader
- Target the IDENTITY, not the behavior
- Never generic (specific to their world)
- Under 12 words (cognitive load limit)

---

## Subheadline Formula

### The Pattern

```
"Join [OFFER NAME] - [SINGLE TRANSFORMATION OUTCOME]"
```

### Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Action verb | Creates momentum | "Join", "Download", "Get" |
| Offer name | Concrete thing to want | "Our Scaling Workshop" |
| Dash separator | Visual pause | "-" |
| Transformation | The OUTCOME, not mechanism | "Remove Yourself as Single Point of Failure" |

### Rules

- ONE outcome only (never a list)
- Outcome = TRANSFORMATION, not mechanism
- Use their language (how THEY describe the pain)
- Under 15 words total

---

## Credibility Statement

### The Pattern

```
"It's a [SPECIFIC FORMAT] where you'll receive [TANGIBLE PROMISE] from [VERIFIABLE AUTHORITY]"
```

### Credibility Proof Hierarchy

| Proof Type | Credibility Level | Example |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| Revenue/Results | Highest | "$100M+ in combined revenue" |
| Famous Client/Company | High | "the team behind [Known Company]" |
| Volume | Medium-High | "helped 10,000+ businesses" |
| Time in Business | Medium | "8 years of experience" |
| Credentials | Lower | "Harvard MBA" |

### Rules

- Always include a number (format, results, or volume)
- Authority must be verifiable (not vague claims)
- Promise must be tangible (not "you'll learn")
- Under 30 words

---

## CTA Button Formulas

### The Pattern

```
"I'M READY TO [TRANSFORMATION VERB]"
```

### Variations

| Pattern | Structure | Example | Best For |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Readiness Declaration | "I'M READY TO [VERB]" | "I'M READY TO SCALE" | High-commitment offers |
| Desire Confirmation | "YES, I WANT [THING]" | "YES, I WANT THE PLAYBOOK" | Lead magnets |
| Command Request | "SEND ME [THING]" | "SEND ME THE BLUEPRINT" | Free resources |
| Access Claim | "GET INSTANT ACCESS" | "GET INSTANT ACCESS" | Digital products |

### CTA Rules

- ALL CAPS always
- First person (I/MY/ME)
- 4 words maximum
- Active verb (never passive)
- Must match headline transformation

---

## The 3-Pillar Value Stack

**Why exactly 3 pillars?**

| Number | Psychology | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| 1 pillar | Incomplete | "That's it?" |
| 2 pillars | Either/or | "Which one matters?" |
| **3 pillars** | **Complete, believable** | **"This covers everything"** |
| 4+ pillars | Overwhelming | "They're padding the list" |

### Pillar #1: ACCESS (Who They Get)

```
#1 [AUTHORITY LABEL]
Get [PROXIMITY TYPE] with [SPECIFIC PEOPLE] who've [CREDIBILITY PROOF]
```

**Example:** "Get face time with operators who've scaled to $100M+"

### Pillar #2: FRAMEWORK (What System They Get)

```
#2 [METHODOLOGY NAME]
Get the same [TOOLS/SYSTEM] we use with [IMPRESSIVE REFERENCE]
```

**Example:** "Get the same tools and templates we use with portfolio companies"

### Pillar #3: ACTION (What They Leave With)

```
#3 [DELIVERABLE TYPE]
Walk away with [SPECIFIC, PERSONALIZED OUTPUT] for [THEIR SITUATION]
```

**Example:** "Walk away with a personalized action plan specific to your business"

---

## FAQ Objection Handling

### The 4 Core Fears

1. **Fear of Unknown** → "What actually happens?"
2. **Fear of Wasted Time** → "What do I walk away with?"
3. **Fear of Wrong Fit** → "Is this right for me?"
4. **Fear of Loss** → "How much does it cost?"

### FAQ 1: Process Question

```
Q: "What actually happens during [experience]?"

A: [Step-by-step description] + [Specific details] + [Comfort statement]
```

### FAQ 2: Outcome Question

```
Q: "What do I walk away with?"

A: [Specific deliverables list] + [Format details] + [Implementation promise]
```

### FAQ 3: Fit Question

```
Q: "Is this right for my [situation]?"

A: [Clear qualifier] + [Ideal client] + [Who it's NOT for] + [Confidence statement]
```

### FAQ 4: Investment Question

```
Q: "How much [does it cost / time required]?"

A: [Direct answer] + [Value reframe] + [Cost of inaction] + [Comparison anchor]
```

---

## Qualifying Gate

### The Pattern

```
"Best for [SPECIFIC AUDIENCE] doing [QUANTIFIABLE RANGE]"
```

### Examples

| Offer Type | Qualifier |
|------------|-----------|
| Business Workshop | "For businesses doing $1M-$100M/year" |
| Developer Tool | "For developers with 2+ years experience" |
| Course | "For founders who've validated their product" |
| Consulting | "For agencies billing $50K+/month" |

**Placement**: Always BEFORE final CTA, not after.

---

## Testimonial Structure

### The Formula

```
"[SPECIFIC RESULT with NUMBER] + [TIMEFRAME] + [EMOTIONAL TRANSFORMATION]"
```

**Example:**
```
"This workshop helped me 10x my revenue in 6 months.
I finally feel like a CEO, not a firefighter."
- Sarah Chen, Founder @ TechScale ($2M ARR)
```
