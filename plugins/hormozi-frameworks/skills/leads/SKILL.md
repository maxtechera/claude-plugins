## The Core Four Framework

**"There are only four ways to let people know about your business."**

```
                 ┌──────────────┐
                 │   AUDIENCE   │
                 └──────────────┘
                        │
        ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
        │               │               │
   KNOW YOU        DON'T KNOW      LEVERAGE
        │               │               │
   ┌────┴────┐     ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐
   │         │     │         │    │         │
  WARM     COLD   FREE     PAID  AFFILIATE REFERRAL
OUTREACH OUTREACH CONTENT   ADS
```

### Decision Matrix

| Your Situation | Primary Method | Secondary |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| More time than money | Warm → Content | Cold outreach |
| More money than time | Paid ads | Cold outreach (hired) |
| Just starting | Warm outreach | Content |
| Proven offer | Paid ads + Content | Affiliates |
| Strong network | Warm + Referrals | Content |

---

## The Rule of 100

**Do 100 primary actions EVERY DAY.**

### What Counts as 1

| Channel | 1 Unit |
|---------|--------|
| Cold Email | 1 personalized email |
| Cold DM | 1 personalized message |
| Cold Call | 1 conversation (not voicemail) |
| Content | 1 piece of content published |
| Warm Outreach | 1 meaningful touchpoint |

### Rule of 100 Commitment

```
First 4 hours of every day = Lead generation
100 actions minimum
No exceptions
```

### Expected Results

| Actions | Responses (20%) | Conversions (5% of responses) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| 100/day | 20 | 1 |
| 500/week | 100 | 5 |
| 2000/month | 400 | 20 |

---

## Warm Outreach

### Who to Contact (in order)

1. **Past customers** - Already trust you
2. **Past colleagues** - Know your work
3. **Friends & family** - Want to help
4. **Acquaintances** - Weak ties = new networks
5. **Followers/subscribers** - Opted in

### The ACA Framework

```
A - Acknowledge: Reference something specific about them
C - Compliment: Genuine appreciation
A - Ask: "Do you know anyone who...?" (NOT "are you interested?")
```

### Warm Outreach Script

```
Hey [Name]!

[Specific reference to them - recent post, achievement, etc.]

I'm helping [specific type of person] with [specific outcome].
Do you know anyone who might benefit from that?

No pressure at all - just trying to connect with the right people.

[Your name]
```

### Why "Do You Know Anyone?" Works

- Removes pressure from them
- Gets referrals even from non-buyers
- Maintains the relationship
- Feels like helping, not selling

---

## Cold Outreach

### Cold Email Template

```
Subject: [Specific observation about their business]

Hey [Name],

[1 sentence about something specific you noticed about their work]

We help [specific type of person/company] [achieve specific result].
Recently helped [similar company] [specific metric/outcome].

Worth a quick chat to see if we can help?

[Your name]

P.S. [Personal touch or additional value]
```

### Cold DM Template

```
Hey [Name] -

[Reference to their content/work]

Quick question: are you currently focused on [problem you solve]?

[Your name]
```

### Response Rate Benchmarks

| Channel | Open Rate | Response Rate |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Cold Email | 20-40% | 1-5% |
| Cold DM | N/A | 10-20% |
| Cold Call | N/A | 2-5% conversation |
| LinkedIn | 30-50% accept | 5-15% reply |

---

## Content Framework

### The "How I" vs "How To" Filter

**Transform generic content into credible content:**

| Generic (How To) | Credible (How I) |
|------------------|------------------|
| How to get more leads | How I got 1,000 leads in 30 days using X |
| How to automate your business | How I automated 80% of my workflow |
| How to grow on Instagram | How I grew from 0 to 10K followers |
| How to use AI coding tools | How I shipped 3x faster with AI |

### Why "How I" Works

- Requires receipts (proof)
- Establishes authority through results
- Unique (your story can't be copied)
- More engaging and personal

### Content Equation

```
Leads = Volume x Quality x Consistency
```

- **Volume**: Post frequently (minimum 1x/day on primary platform)
- **Quality**: Valuable, specific, actionable
- **Consistency**: Same time, same format, never miss

### Content Pillars

| Pillar | % of Content | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Educational** | 40% | Teach something valuable |
| **Inspirational** | 30% | Share journey, wins, lessons |
| **Entertaining** | 20% | Hook with story, humor |
| **Promotional** | 10% | Direct offer/CTA |

---

## Lead Magnet Framework

### Three Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Reveal Problem** | Show them a problem they don't know about | Website audit, posture analysis |
| **2. Solve Temporarily** | Sample/trial of your solution | Free trial, first module |
| **3. One Step of Many** | Give one step of multi-step process | First chapter, single template |

### The Salty Pretzel Principle

```
Lead Magnet → Solves One Problem → Creates Desire for Another
                                          ↓
                               Your Core Offer Solves
```

**Example:**
- Free pretzels (lead magnet) → Solves hunger
- Makes them thirsty → Creates desire for drinks
- Buy drinks (core offer) → Your revenue

### Lead Magnet Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Solves a NARROW problem (not broad)
- [ ] Can be consumed in <15 minutes
- [ ] Has immediate, tangible value
- [ ] Reveals need for core offer
- [ ] Could be sold (but you give free)

### Lead Magnet Formats

| Format | Best For | Consumption Time |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Checklist | Actionable quick win | 2 min |
| Template | Immediate utility | 5 min |
| Cheat sheet | Reference guide | 2 min |
| Mini-course | Deeper education | 30-60 min |
| Tool/Calculator | Ongoing utility | 5 min |
| Video training | Visual learners | 10-30 min |
| Free trial | Software/service | Ongoing |

## Paid Ads Framework

### When to Run Paid Ads

**Only when:**
- [ ] Organic content proven (>10K views on similar content)
- [ ] Funnel converts (landing page to lead works)
- [ ] CAC math works (can afford to acquire customers)
- [ ] Creative ready (not just boosting)

### Ad Structure (Hook → Problem → Solution → Proof → Offer → CTA)

```
[0-3 sec]  HOOK: Pattern interrupt, bold claim, curiosity
[3-13 sec] PROBLEM: Agitate the pain
[13-28 sec] SOLUTION: Your approach (not full details)
[28-38 sec] PROOF: Results, testimonials
[38-48 sec] OFFER: What they get
[48-53 sec] CTA: Clear single action
```

### Budget Allocation

| Stage | Daily Budget | Duration |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Testing | $20-50/day | 3-5 days per creative |
| Learning | $50-100/day | 7-14 days |
| Scaling | 10-20% increase | Weekly |

## Quick Diagnosis

**"I'm not getting enough leads..."**

Check in order:
1. **Volume issue** → Are you doing Rule of 100?
2. **Channel issue** → Right channel for your situation?
3. **Message issue** → Is outreach/content compelling?
4. **Offer issue** → Is lead magnet valuable enough?
5. **Follow-up issue** → Are you nurturing properly?
