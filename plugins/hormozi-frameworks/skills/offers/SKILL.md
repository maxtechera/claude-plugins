# $100M Offers Skill

Frameworks from Alex Hormozi's "$100M Offers: How to Make Offers So Good People Feel Stupid Saying No"

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating a new offer, product, or service
- Reviewing why an offer isn't converting
- Pricing decisions
- Crafting guarantees
- Writing sales pages or offer copy

---

## The Value Equation

**The most important formula in this book:**

```
           Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
Value = ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice
```

### Scoring Template

Rate each 1-10 and calculate:

| Variable | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Dream Outcome** | /10 | How big/desirable is the result? |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | /10 | How confident are they it works? |
| **Time Delay** | /10 | How fast do they get results? (lower = better) |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | /10 | How much work for them? (lower = better) |

**Formula**: `(Dream + Likelihood) / (Time + Effort)`

**Target**: Score of 8+ = compelling offer

### Optimization Levers

**To increase Dream Outcome:**
- Make the outcome more specific
- Increase the magnitude of results
- Add emotional/status benefits
- Show the ultimate transformation

**To increase Perceived Likelihood:**
- Add guarantees
- Show social proof (specific results)
- Demonstrate your track record
- Remove risk with trials

**To decrease Time Delay:**
- Promise quick wins in days 1-7
- Show immediate deliverables
- Create "instant access" positioning
- Add fast-track options

**To decrease Effort & Sacrifice:**
- Do more for them (done-for-you)
- Provide templates/swipe files
- Remove technical barriers
- Offer support/help

## Grand Slam Offer Framework

### The 4 Pillars

**1. Starving Crowd**
- Market with urgent, desperate need
- Willing and able to pay
- Growing (not shrinking)

**Questions to validate:**
- Do they have money?
- Are they easy to reach?
- Is this market growing?
- Do they have urgent pain?

**2. Irresistible Value Proposition**
- Value Equation score 8+
- Clear, specific outcome
- Differentiated from competition

**3. Premium Pricing**
- Price that reinforces value
- Not the cheapest option
- Allows excellent delivery

**4. Unbeatable Guarantee**
- Removes buyer's risk
- Demonstrates confidence
- Addresses specific fears

---

## Pricing Strategy

### The 10x Rule

**Price = 1/10th of value delivered**

| Value Delivered | Suggested Price |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| $10,000 outcome | $1,000 |
| $100,000 outcome | $10,000 |
| $1,000,000 outcome | $100,000 |

### Price Increase Justification

To raise prices, increase ONE of:
1. **Dream Outcome** (bigger promise)
2. **Likelihood** (more proof)
3. **Speed** (faster results)
4. **Ease** (less work for them)

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price Range | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | Lead magnets |
| Tripwire | $7-$47 | Low-risk trial |
| Core | $97-$997 | Main offer |
| Premium | $1K-$10K | Done-with-you |
| High-Ticket | $10K+ | Done-for-you |

---

## Value Stacking

### The Formula

```
Stack = Core Offer + Bonuses that:
  1. Solve adjacent problems
  2. Remove obstacles
  3. Accelerate results
```

### Bonus Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Quick Win** | Immediate small result | "90-day roadmap" |
| **Obstacle Removal** | Solves common blocker | "Tech setup guide" |
| **Accelerator** | Speeds up main result | "Priority support" |
| **Community** | Adds ongoing value | "Private Slack access" |
| **Templates** | Reduces effort | "Copy-paste scripts" |

### Stack Presentation

```
WHAT YOU GET:
✓ [Core Offer Name] ........................ $X,XXX value
✓ BONUS 1: [Quick Win] ..................... $XXX value
✓ BONUS 2: [Obstacle Removal] .............. $XXX value
✓ BONUS 3: [Accelerator] ................... $XXX value
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL VALUE: $X,XXX

YOUR INVESTMENT: $XXX
```

## Guarantee Framework

### Types by Risk Level

| Type | Formula | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Unconditional** | "100% refund, no questions, X days" | High-trust needed, proven delivery |
| **Conditional** | "Do X, get Y, or full refund" | Filter out non-serious buyers |
| **Anti-Guarantee** | "All sales final - this is for serious people only" | Exclusivity positioning |
| **Performance** | "We work until you succeed" | Service businesses |
| **Hybrid** | "Refund OR we keep working free" | Best of both |

### Guarantee Copy Template

```
OUR [OUTCOME] GUARANTEE

If you [complete specific actions] within [timeframe]
and don't [achieve specific measurable result],
we'll [specific remedy: refund/keep working/compensate].

No fine print. No hassle.
```

### Conditional Guarantee Requirements

List specific, measurable actions they must take:
- [ ] Complete all modules
- [ ] Attend all calls
- [ ] Submit all assignments
- [ ] Implement within 30 days

## Delivery Cube

Use to design HOW you deliver your offer:

| Dimension | Low Cost | Medium | High Cost |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Format** | DIY course | Group coaching | 1:1 |
| **Ratio** | 1:many | Small group | 1:1 |
| **Medium** | Async/recorded | Live virtual | In-person |
| **Cadence** | Evergreen | Cohort | Custom schedule |
| **Duration** | Self-paced | Fixed program | Ongoing |
| **Support** | Community | Group calls | Private access |

### Trim & Stack Process

1. **List** all possible delivery methods
2. **Score** each: Cost (1-10) vs. Perceived Value (1-10)
3. **Keep** high value, low cost items
4. **Remove** low value, high cost items
5. **Add** what's missing for completeness

## Naming Formula

### Structure

```
[Outcome/Result] + [Mechanism/Method] + [Timeframe/Specificity]
```

### Examples

| Name | Breakdown |
|------|-----------|
| "90-Day Scaling Sprint" | Time + Outcome + Energy |
| "AI Mastery System" | Topic + Proprietary feel |
| "The Revenue Accelerator" | Outcome + Mechanism |
| "Claude Code Playbook" | Tool + Format |

### Naming Checklist

- [ ] Promises a result (not just a topic)
- [ ] Feels proprietary (can't be compared)
- [ ] Is memorable and repeatable
- [ ] Includes specificity (number, time, method)
- [ ] Sounds premium (not generic)

---

## Offer Review Checklist

Use when reviewing any offer:

### Value Equation Check
- [ ] Dream Outcome clearly stated
- [ ] Proof of likelihood (testimonials, case studies)
- [ ] Speed to result emphasized
- [ ] Effort reduction highlighted

### Grand Slam Components
- [ ] Target market is starving (urgent need)
- [ ] Value proposition is specific and differentiated
- [ ] Price is premium (not competing on cheap)
- [ ] Guarantee removes risk

### Presentation
- [ ] Value stack is visible
- [ ] Bonuses add real value
- [ ] Guarantee is clear and prominent
- [ ] Scarcity/urgency is real (not fake)

## Quick Diagnosis

**"My offer isn't converting..."**

Check these in order:
1. **Wrong audience** - Is this a starving crowd?
2. **Low perceived value** - Run Value Equation
3. **Too much risk** - Strengthen guarantee
4. **Price mismatch** - Apply 10x rule
5. **Unclear promise** - Sharpen dream outcome
