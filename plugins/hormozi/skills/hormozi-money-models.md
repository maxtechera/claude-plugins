# $100M Money Models Skill

Frameworks from Alex Hormozi's "$100M Money Models: How To Make Money"

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing revenue/business model
- Creating upsell/downsell sequences
- Planning subscription/continuity offers
- Optimizing customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Structuring offer stacks

---

## Core Definition

**Money Model**: A deliberate sequence of offers - what you offer, when you offer it, and how you offer it to make as much money as you can as fast as you can.

**Ideal Outcome**: Make enough money from one customer to acquire and service at least two more customers in less than 30 days.

## Stage I: Attraction Offers

### Purpose

Get new customers while:
- Covering (or exceeding) acquisition cost
- Qualifying serious buyers
- Building relationship for higher-ticket offers

### Attraction Offer Types

| Type | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Loss Leader** | Sell below cost to acquire | High-LTV backend, proven upsell path |
| **Break-Even** | Cover costs exactly | Testing new markets |
| **Profit Leader** | Make money immediately | Ideal - self-funding growth |

### The Self-Funding Acquisition Formula

```
Revenue from Attraction Offer ≥ Cost to Acquire Customer
```

**When this works, you can:**
- Scale without external capital
- Outspend competitors on acquisition
- Grow infinitely (profit funds growth)

### Attraction Offer Pricing

| Offer Type | Price Range | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Free Lead Magnet | $0 | Capture contact info |
| Tripwire | $7-$47 | Filter buyers from browsers |
| Low-Ticket | $47-$197 | Cover ad costs |
| Core Offer | $197-$997 | Primary revenue |

### Tripwire Strategy

**Definition**: Low-priced offer that turns a lead into a buyer

**Benefits:**
- Buyers are 10x more likely to buy again
- Covers acquisition cost
- Qualifies serious prospects
- Reduces refunds on higher offers

**Example Tripwires:**
- $27 mini-course
- $47 template pack
- $17 strategy session
- $7 ebook with bonuses

---

## Stage II: Upsells & Downsells

### Upsell Framework

**Timing**: Immediately after purchase (highest buying temperature)

### Upsell Types

| Type | Description | Price Multiple |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **More of Same** | Bulk, extended, premium version | 2-3x |
| **Faster Results** | Accelerator, priority, done-for-you | 3-10x |
| **Related Problem** | Adjacent solution they need next | 1-2x |
| **Access** | Community, coaching, direct support | 2-5x |
| **Implementation** | Done-with-you or done-for-you | 5-20x |

### Upsell Timing

```
Purchase → Thank You Page → UPSELL (immediate)
                              ↓
                         Yes → Deliver
                              ↓
                         No → DOWNSELL
```

### Downsell Framework

**Timing**: When customer declines upsell or primary offer

### Downsell Types

| Type | Description | Price Point |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Payment Plan** | Same offer, split payments | Same total |
| **Lite Version** | Stripped-down version | 30-50% |
| **Trial** | Time-limited full access | Low or free |
| **Alternative** | Different format/approach | Similar |

### The Offer Stack

```
LEAD MAGNET (Free)
     │
     ▼
TRIPWIRE ($7-$47)
     │
     ├──→ [Declined] → Mini Downsell ($17)
     │
     ▼
CORE OFFER ($197-$997)
     │
     ├──→ [Declined] → Payment Plan
     │
     ▼
UPSELL 1 ($497-$2,997)
     │
     ├──→ [Declined] → Lite Version ($297)
     │
     ▼
UPSELL 2 ($2,997-$9,997)
     │
     ├──→ [Declined] → Alternative ($997)
     │
     ▼
CONTINUITY ($97-$297/month)
```

### Upsell Script Framework

```
"Before you go, I have something for people who [are serious / want faster results / etc.]

[What it is - 1 sentence]

[Why it helps - the outcome]

[Social proof - who else has done it]

[The offer - what they get]

[Price anchor + actual price]

[CTA - yes or no]"
```

---

## LTV Optimization

### LTV Formula

```
LTV = Average Monthly Revenue × Average Customer Lifespan (months)
```

**Example:** $100/month × 18 months = $1,800 LTV

### LTV Levers

| Lever | Action | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Increase revenue | Upsells, price raises | Direct increase |
| Increase lifespan | Retention improvements | Multiplicative |
| Decrease CAC | Better targeting, organic | More profit |

### The CAC:LTV Ratio

| Ratio | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| < 1:1 | Losing money | Fix urgently |
| 1:1 - 2:1 | Break-even | Optimize |
| 3:1 | Healthy | Scale |
| 5:1+ | Excellent | Scale aggressively |

---

## The 30-Day Cash Cycle

**Goal**: Recoup acquisition cost within 30 days

### Example Timeline

```
Day 0:  Lead → Tripwire .............. $27 revenue
Day 0:  Post-purchase Upsell ........ $197 revenue
Day 3:  Email sequence → Core offer . $497 revenue
Day 7:  Upsell offer ................ $997 revenue
Day 14: Continuity offer starts ..... $97/mo
        ─────────────────────────────────────────
Day 30: Total Revenue: $1,815
        CAC: $100
        Net: $1,715 profit (17x CAC)
```

### 30-Day Cash Cycle Audit

| Day | Touchpoint | Offer | Revenue Target |
|-----|------------|-------|----------------|
| 0 | Purchase | Tripwire | Cover CAC |
| 0 | Thank You Page | Upsell 1 | 2x profit |
| 1-3 | Email | Core Offer | 3x profit |
| 7 | Email | Upsell 2 | 5x profit |
| 14 | Email | Continuity | Recurring start |
| 30 | Check | Total revenue | > 3x CAC |

## Quick Diagnosis

**"I'm not making enough per customer..."**

Check in order:
1. **No upsell** → Add immediate post-purchase upsell
2. **No continuity** → Create recurring offer
3. **Weak retention** → Fix onboarding and engagement
4. **Single product** → Add cross-sells
5. **No referrals** → Implement referral program

**"My CAC is too high..."**

Check in order:
1. **No tripwire** → Add low-ticket front-end
2. **Weak conversion** → Improve sales page/process
3. **Wrong channel** → Test different acquisition methods
4. **No organic** → Build content engine
