# Value Equation

The core formula from Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers.

## The Formula

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Success) / (Time to Result × Effort Required)
```

**To increase value**: Increase the top, decrease the bottom.

## The 4 Levers

### 1. Dream Outcome (Increase)
What they actually want, not what you sell.

**Questions**:
- What's the real outcome they dream about?
- What would they brag about to friends?
- What keeps them up at night?

**Examples**:
- BAD: "Learn Spanish"
- GOOD: "Order confidently at restaurants in Barcelona"

### 2. Likelihood of Success (Increase)
Their belief it will work for THEM.

**Increase with**:
- Social proof (testimonials, case studies)
- Specificity (exact steps, numbers)
- Guarantees (risk reversal)
- Credentials (your results)

### 3. Time to Result (Decrease)
How fast they see results.

**Questions**:
- Can you give a quick win in the first session?
- Can you show progress markers?
- Can you batch the learning?

**Examples**:
- BAD: "12-month program"
- GOOD: "First automation running in 60 minutes"

### 4. Effort Required (Decrease)
How much work they have to do.

**Questions**:
- Can you do more of the work for them?
- Can you simplify the process?
- Can you provide templates/shortcuts?

**Examples**:
- BAD: "Learn to code from scratch"
- GOOD: "Copy-paste these prompts"

## Scoring Your Offer

Rate each lever 1-10:
- Dream Outcome: __/10
- Likelihood: __/10
- Time (inverse): __/10 (10 = instant, 1 = years)
- Effort (inverse): __/10 (10 = done-for-you, 1 = hard work)

**Score**: (Dream × Likelihood) / (Time × Effort)

**Target**: 8+ is good. 15+ is irresistible.

## Quick Audit

For any offer, ask:
1. Is the dream outcome crystal clear?
2. Do they believe it will work for them?
3. How fast is the first win?
4. How much work do they have to do?
