# Sabotage Pattern Detection

Quick check for common patterns that kill productivity.

## The 4 Patterns

### 1. Noble Dispersion
**Symptom**: 5+ tasks open, 0 completed
**Fix**: Pick ONE. Finish it. Then next.

### 2. Start Dopamine
**Symptom**: Starting new projects instead of finishing current ones
**Fix**: Close before you open. Nothing new until current ships.

### 3. Perfectionism
**Symptom**: 5+ days without shipping anything
**Fix**: Ship broken > Ship perfect. Done beats perfect.

### 4. Premature Optimization
**Symptom**: More tool changes than actual output
**Fix**: Stop tuning. Start shipping.

## Quick Check

Ask yourself:
1. How many things are "in progress" right now? (If >3, problem)
2. When did I last ship something? (If >3 days, problem)
3. Am I building tools or building product? (If tools, problem)
4. Am I researching or doing? (If researching >1 hour, problem)

## Emergency Protocol

If 2+ patterns are active:
1. Sleep (seriously)
2. Exercise
3. Ship ONE tiny thing
4. Cut all inputs (Twitter, email, Slack)
5. Write plan in <10 lines

## Daily Practice

End each day with:
- What did I SHIP today? (not "work on")
- What's the ONE thing for tomorrow?
