```

## Key Frameworks

### Video Structure
```
HOOK (0-30 sec)
├── Pattern interrupt
├── Stakes
├── Credibility
└── Promise

BODY
├── Point 1 + Story
├── Point 2 + Story
└── Point 3 + Story

CONCLUSION
├── Recap
├── CTA
└── Teaser
```

### Hook Templates
- **Money Hook**: "I spent $X on..."
- **Journey Hook**: "X months ago I was... Today..."
- **Counterintuitive**: "Everyone says X. They're wrong."
- **Failure Hook**: "This mistake cost me $X"
- **Secret Hook**: "What experts won't tell you..."

### The 2-Minute Rule
Every 2 minutes, include:
- A new visual/B-roll
- A story or example
- An unexpected insight
- A callback to the promise
