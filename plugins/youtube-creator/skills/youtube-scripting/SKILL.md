---

## Video Structure Template

### The Core Framework

```
HOOK (0-30 sec)
├── Pattern interrupt (0-3 sec)
├── Stakes/Problem (3-10 sec)
├── Credibility (10-20 sec)
└── Promise/Preview (20-30 sec)

BODY (Main Content)
├── Point 1 + Story/Example
├── Point 2 + Story/Example
├── Point 3 + Story/Example
└── (Retention hooks between each)

CONCLUSION (Final 60 sec)
├── Recap key points
├── Clear CTA
└── Teaser for next video
```

---

## The Hook Formula

### First 30 Seconds Script

```
[0-3 sec] PATTERN INTERRUPT
"[Shocking statement or number]..."

[3-10 sec] STAKES
"...and [unexpected consequence or tension]"

[10-20 sec] CREDIBILITY
"After [experience/time/achievement]..."

[20-30 sec] PROMISE
"Here's exactly [what they'll learn/get]"
```

### Hook Templates

**Money Hook**
```
"I spent $[X] on [thing]... and here's what happened."
```

**Journey Hook**
```
"[X] months ago, I was [bad situation]. Today, [good situation].
Here's exactly how I did it."
```

**Counterintuitive Hook**
```
"Everyone says you should [common advice].
That's exactly why you're stuck."
```

**Failure Hook**
```
"This mistake cost me $[X]. Don't make the same one."
```

**Secret Hook**
```
"What [experts] won't tell you about [topic]..."
```

## Body Content Structure

### The 3-Point Framework

Most videos work best with 3 main points:

```
POINT 1 (Foundation)
├── Introduce concept
├── Story/Example
├── Key takeaway
└── Transition hook → "But that's not enough..."

POINT 2 (Build)
├── Expand on foundation
├── Deeper example
├── Practical application
└── Transition hook → "Here's where it gets interesting..."

POINT 3 (Transform)
├── Advanced insight
├── Case study/proof
├── Implementation steps
└── Transition to conclusion
```

### Retention Hooks

Place between sections to keep viewers watching:

```
"But here's where most people mess up..."
"The next part is the key to all of this..."
"Stay with me because this changes everything..."
"What I'm about to show you took me [X] to figure out..."
"Don't skip this part - it's the difference between [A] and [B]..."
```

### The 2-Minute Rule

Every 2 minutes, include:
- A new visual/B-roll
- A story or example
- An unexpected insight
- A callback to the promise

## Pacing Guide

### Speaking Pace

| Energy Level | Words/Minute | Use For |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| High energy | 180-200 | Hooks, exciting reveals |
| Normal | 150-170 | Main content |
| Slow/emphasis | 100-130 | Key points, emotions |

### Visual Pace

| Cut Frequency | Use For |
|---------------|---------|
| Every 2-3 sec | High energy, montages |
| Every 5-8 sec | Normal explanations |
| 10+ sec | Emotional moments, emphasis |

---

## Script Template

```markdown
# [Video Title]

## Metadata
- Target Length: [X] minutes
- Target Audience: [Who]
- Main Takeaway: [One sentence]

---

## HOOK (0-30 sec)

[PATTERN INTERRUPT - 3 sec]
"[Opening line]"

[STAKES - 7 sec]
"[Why this matters]"

[CREDIBILITY - 10 sec]
"[Your relevant experience]"

[PROMISE - 10 sec]
"[What they'll learn]"

---

## POINT 1: [Title] (2-3 min)

### Setup
[Introduce the concept]

### Story/Example
[Specific story that illustrates the point]

### Takeaway
"The key here is [main lesson]"

### Transition
"But that's only part of it..."

---

## POINT 2: [Title] (2-3 min)

[Same structure as Point 1]

---

## POINT 3: [Title] (2-3 min)

[Same structure as Point 1]

---

## CONCLUSION (60 sec)

### Recap
"So remember:
1. [Point 1 summary]
2. [Point 2 summary]
3. [Point 3 summary]"

### CTA
"If this helped, [subscribe/like/comment]"

### Teaser
"Next week, I'm covering [topic]"

---

## B-Roll Notes
- [Timestamp]: [What to show]
- [Timestamp]: [What to show]

## Graphics/Text
- [Timestamp]: [Text overlay]
- [Timestamp]: [Text overlay]
```

---

## Thumbnail + Title Formula

### Title Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| How I + Result + Time | "How I Made $100K in 90 Days" |
| Number + Benefit | "5 Tools That 10x'd My Productivity" |
| What/Why + Curiosity | "Why Smart People Stay Broke" |
| Stop/Start | "Stop Doing X (Do This Instead)" |
| Result Without Pain | "Get Fit Without the Gym" |

### Title Checklist

- [ ] Under 60 characters
- [ ] Includes number or specific result
- [ ] Creates curiosity gap
- [ ] Matches thumbnail message
- [ ] No clickbait (delivers on promise)

### Thumbnail Elements

1. **Face** - Clear emotion (shock, curiosity, excitement)
2. **Text** - 3-4 words max, high contrast
3. **Visual** - Supports the story (before/after, money, tools)
4. **Color** - Contrasts with YouTube red

## Pre-Recording Checklist

Before hitting record:

- [ ] Script reviewed and practiced
- [ ] Key points memorized (not reading)
- [ ] Energy high (do warmup)
- [ ] Camera/audio tested
- [ ] B-roll list ready
- [ ] Thumbnail concept decided
- [ ] Title finalized

## Video Types

### Tutorial (How-To)

```
Hook → Problem → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Results → CTA
```

Best for: Teaching specific skills

### Story-Based

```
Hook → Setup (before) → Struggle → Turning point → After → Lessons → CTA
```

Best for: Personal journey, case studies

### List Format

```
Hook → Why this matters → Item 1 → Item 2 → ... → Item N → Best one → CTA
```

Best for: Tools, tips, examples

### Comparison

```
Hook → Criteria → Option A → Option B → Verdict → Who should use what → CTA
```

Best for: Tool reviews, method comparisons

## Recording Tips

### Energy Management

- Record hooks first (highest energy)
- Take breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Stand up, even if not on camera
- Speak to ONE person, not an audience

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Reading script | Use bullet points, practice |
| Monotone voice | Vary pitch and pace |
| No eye contact | Look at camera lens |
| Too long | Cut ruthlessly in edit |
| Weak hook | Re-record hook multiple times |
