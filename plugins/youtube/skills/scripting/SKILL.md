# YouTube Scripting

Templates for engaging video scripts.

## Video Structure

```
HOOK (0-10 sec)
├── Bold statement or surprising stat
├── Personal stake ("I spent...", "I lost...")
└── Promise of value

INTRO (10-30 sec)
├── Quick credibility (1 sentence)
├── What they'll learn (bullet points)
└── Why it matters to THEM

BODY (Main content)
├── Point 1: Setup problem
├── Point 2: Show solution
├── Point 3: Prove it works
└── Each point: Story → Lesson → Action

CLOSE (Last 30 sec)
├── Recap key takeaway (1 sentence)
├── Clear CTA
└── Tease next video
```

## Hook Templates

**The Money Hook:**
```
"I spent $[X] on [thing]...
and I'm going to show you exactly what happened."
```

**The Journey Hook:**
```
"[Time] ago, I was [bad situation].
Today, [good situation].
Here's exactly how I did it."
```

**The Mistake Hook:**
```
"I made a $[X] mistake...
so you don't have to."
```

## Retention Techniques

**Every 30-60 seconds:**
- Visual change (B-roll, screen, angle)
- Open loop ("but here's where it gets interesting...")
- Pattern interrupt (pause, change tone)

**Keep them watching:**
- Numbers in first 3 words
- "Stay until the end for [specific thing]"
- Multiple small payoffs, not just one at the end

## Script Template

```markdown
# [VIDEO TITLE]

## HOOK (0-10 sec)
